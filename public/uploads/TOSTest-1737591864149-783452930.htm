 reserves the right to change the price or features of all services upon
 30 days notice. Such notice will be provided by email and/or through 
the Service. If such a change takes place and you choose not to

payment of your account at the new rate.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">All
 invoices are due net 30, except for credit card payments, which are due
 upon receipt. Failure to pay any charges may results in the suspension 
or cancellation of your account.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Invoices
 are sent to the email on file, and for customers living in the United 
States who are on annual terms, a physical copy of the invoice will be 
mailed as well.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Account prices 
are billed exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing 
authorities, and you shall be responsible for any such tax, levy, or 
duty associated with your use of the Service.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Files.com
 is required to collect sales tax in certain USA states that tax the 
type of services we provide and where we also meet certain sales

sales tax from can be found in our <a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/">Sales Tax documentation</a>,
 and may change as Files.com grows and gains additional sales tax nexus,
 or if states change their laws that determine nexus. In the wake of the
 <em class="">Wayfair</em> Supreme Court decision, we expect several 
more states to expand their sales tax nexus definitions. If your primary
 billing address is in a state where Files.com is required to collect 
sales tax, we will add the appropriate sales tax to your invoice and 
collect sales tax.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Customers on

 stop using, any such a third party vendor for any reason at any time. 
You will be responsible for any fees or expenses incurred by Files.com

Usage &amp; User Calculation</a></h2><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Files.com
 leverages Amazon S3 for “at-rest” storage and retrieval of the files on
 your account. Amazon S3 has a very complicated billing scheme, and we 
have attempted to craft our usage calculation scheme to be considerably 
simpler than Amazon’s while at the same time ensuring that we collect 
enough revenue from our customers to be able to pay our Amazon S3 bill.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Usage
 is calculated for each 30-day “Usage Period” that your account is open.
 If your account is billed monthly, your Usage Period will coincide with
 your monthly billing term. If your account is billed annually, we 
divide your annual billing term into twelve Usage Periods. If your 
account is billed on some other interval, we will divide your billing 
term into Usage Periods that are 30 days long.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">For
 each Usage Period, we will calculate a single sum called “Usage” that 
represents your total usage of the Service. This “Usage” number is the 
sum of your “Storage Usage” and your “Transfer Usage.” You can find 
additional details in our&nbsp;<strong class="font-semibold"><a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/">Usage documentation</a></strong>.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Each
 account comes with a generous amount of Usage included for every Usage 
Period, determined by your plan. Should the Usage in any Usage Period 
exceed the included amount, any excess Usage will be billed at a low 
price determined by your agreement.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Invoices
 for Usage are issued immediately at the end of each Usage Period and 
are due upon receipt, regardless of whether your Account is otherwise 
prepaid for a longer term.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Each Usage Period is evaluated independently, and unused usage does not “rollover” from one Usage Period to the next.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">For
 billing purposes, your user count is simply the highest number of 
Billable users reached at any point during the Usage Period. You can 
find additional details in our&nbsp;<strong class="font-semibold"><a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground font-medium underline underline-offset-4" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/">Billable User documentation</a></strong>.</p><h2 class="heading-scroll-margin text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10 first:mt-0 [&amp;_&gt;_a]:text-foreground" id="5-api-calls"><a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/legal/terms#5-api-calls">5.

 may cancel your account at any time. Account cancellations may be made 
through the Service itself on the Settings tab. For security purposes, 
we do NOT accept cancellation notices via phone or email. Upon 
cancellation, your data will be removed from the system within 7 days, 
and there is no mechanism for restoring data once it is removed from the
 system.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">If you are a new 
customer and cancel your account within ninety (90) days of initiating 
service with Files.com, you are entitled to a full refund of all monies 
paid to Files.com, less any overages or excess Usage (to which you 
remain responsible to pay). Please request a refund when cancelling in 
order for this to be processed simultaneously.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">If
 you are on an annual or multi-year term, you are obligated to pay for 
the entire term even if you cancel early, except if you are a new

 for any reason (including SLA credits) will not be granted if they are 
requested more than 30 days after account cancellation.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">No
 refund will be given in any instance if Files.com determines, in its 
sole and reasonable discretion, that you or any user on your account 
breached any part of these Terms of Service.</p><h2 class="heading-scroll-margin text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10 first:mt-0 [&amp;_&gt;_a]:text-foreground" id="7-service-level-agreement-sla"><a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/legal/terms#7-service-level-agreement-sla">7.

 recognize that downtime can be costly and reflect poorly on your

to your credit card (if you have one on file) or a service credit toward
 future payments (if you do not have a credit card on file) if certain 
uptime goals are not met and you are on a qualifying plan and request a

SFTP services are available on ports 80, 443, 21, 990, and 22 on at

 will try to resolve the dispute informally by contacting you via email.
 If a dispute is not resolved within 30 days of submission, you or 
Files.com may bring a formal proceeding.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Any
 dispute arising under these Terms of Service that is not resolved

 single arbitrator with the American Arbitration Association (AAA), in 
accordance with its relevant industry rules, if any. The parties agree

 accordance with the laws of the United States and the State of Nevada. 
The arbitration will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. The 
Arbitrator will have the authority to grant injunctive relief and 
specific performance to enforce the terms of this Agreement. Judgment on
 any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in any court of 
competent jurisdiction.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">To the

agree that you will not be a member of any putative or actual class in a
 class action brought by anyone else, nor will you seek to become a 
class representative. If any portion of this paragraph is found to be 
void or unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and 
only that claim) shall be resolved in federal court rather than in 
arbitration; if there is no federal jurisdiction, the case shall be 
resolved in Nevada state court.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">In
 the event that you are able to sufficiently demonstrate that the costs 
of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to costs of litigation, 
Files.com may, but is not obligated to, mutually agree to have the 
arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, in 
person in the county where you live, or at another mutually agreed 
location.</p><p class="leading-7 mt-6 first:mt-0">Any cause of action or
 claim you may have with respect to the Site or Service must be

this section, if we have a reasonable basis to believe that you have in 
any manner violated or threatened to violate any of our intellectual 
property rights, we may bring suit in any state or federal court in the 
state of Nevada, rather than through arbitration. In such instances, you
 agree that you will submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal
 courts in the state of Nevada.</p><h2 class="heading-scroll-margin text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight mt-10 first:mt-0 [&amp;_&gt;_a]:text-foreground" id="13-third-party-hyperlinks"><a class="text-brand-red-500 hover:text-muted-foreground" rel="" target="_self" href="https://www.files.com/legal/terms#13-third-party-hyperlinks">13.
